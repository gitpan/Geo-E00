 Hello folks,

  this is an alpha release of the Geo::E00 module.

  The aim of this module is to allow the user to read
  E00 files.

  ARC, LAB, PAL, CNT, INFO sections are currently supported.

  Documentation is available right now, you can read
  the included test.pl program, which tries to convert
  an E00 file to set of SQL statements, to learn how it works.

  Please be aware that this is an early alpha version
  so the API is subject to changes.

  Geo::E00 is released under the GPL end its development
  is funded by Tower Technologies (http://www.towertech.it). 

  Happy hacking!
